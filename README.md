# Pope-survivorlike
Old project I decided to upload
Executable to play: build/SurvivorLike.exe

P - for pause and upgrade menu

Only 3 skills on the left do anything

Lclick - to upgrade the skill

Rclick - to open the skill submenu

Q,E - change spells

Lcontrol (maybe it was Lshift?) - dash

Bask in the glory of my shitty code!
